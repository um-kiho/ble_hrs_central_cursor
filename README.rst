Overview
********

This sample scans for devices that advertise with the :ref:`lib_ble_service_hrs` UUID (0x180D) and initiates a connection when a device is found.
When a device is connected, the sample starts the service discovery procedure.
If this succeeds, the sample subscribes to the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic to receive heart rate notifications.

Building and running
********************

This sample can be found under :file:`samples/bluetooth/ble_hrs_central/` in the |BMshort| folder structure.

For details on how to create, configure, and program a sample, see :ref:`getting_started_with_the_samples`.

Testing
=======

This sample requires two devices to test, one running this sample and another one running the :ref:`ble_hrs_sample` sample.

Complete the following steps to test the sample:

1. Compile and program the application.
#. In the Serial Terminal, observe that the ``BLE HRS Central sample started`` message is printed.
#. Program the other development kit with the :ref:`ble_hrs_sample` sample and reset it.
#. Observe that the ``Scan filter match`` message is printed, followed by ``Connecting to target`` and ``Connected``.
#. Observe that the ``Heart rate service discovered.`` message is printed.
#. Observe that the device starts receiving heart rate measurement notifications.
